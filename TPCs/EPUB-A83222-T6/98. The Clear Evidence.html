                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Those who disbelieved from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists could
                              not have separated (from the faithful) until there had come to them the clear
                              evidence:An apostle from Allah, reciting pure pages,Wherein are all the right ordinances.And those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence
                              had come to them.And they were not enjoined anything except that they should serve Allah, being
                              sincere to Him in obedience, upright, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, and
                              that is the right religion.Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists
                              shall be in the fire of hell, abiding therein; they are the worst of men.(As for) those who believe and do good, surely they are the -best of men.Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow,
                              abiding therein for ever; Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased
                              with Him; that is for him who fears his Lord.
