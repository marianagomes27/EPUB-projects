                              Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and reign over us. For whereas it was the
                              expectation of many, who wished not well unto our Sion, that upon the setting of
                              that bright Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth of most happy memory, some thick and
                              palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this Land, that men should
                              have
                              been in doubt which way they were to walk; and that it should hardly be known, who
                              was
                              to direct the unsettled State; the appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in
                              his strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto
                              all
                              that were well affected exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we beheld the
                              Government established in Your Highness, and Your hopeful Seed, by an undoubted Title,
                              and this also accompanied with peace and tranquillity at home and abroad.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But among all our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts, than the blessed
                              continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word among us; which is that inestimable
                              treasure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof
                              extendeth itself, not only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth
                              and
                              disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.

                              it in that state, wherein the famous Predecessor of Your Highness did leave it: nay,
                              to
                              go forward with the confidence and resolution of a Man in maintaining the truth of
                              Christ, and propagating it far and near, is that which hath so bound and firmly knit
                              the
                              hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You, that Your very name
                              is
                              precious among them: their eye doth behold You with comfort, and they bless You in
                              their
                              hearts, as that sanctified Person, who, under God, is the immediate Author of their
                              true
                              happiness. And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay, but every day
                              increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe, that the zeal of Your Majesty toward
                              the house of God doth not slack or go backward, but is more and more kindled,
                              manifesting itself abroad in the farthest parts of Christendom, by writing in
                              defence of the Truth, (which hath given such a blow unto that man of sin, as will
                              not be
                              healed,) and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by frequenting
                              the
                              house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by cherishing the Teachers thereof, by
                              caring for the Church, as a most tender and loving nursing Father.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">There are infinite arguments of this right christian and religious affection in Your
                              Majesty; but none is more focible to declare it to others than the vehement and
                              perpetuated desire of accomplishing and publishing of this work, which now with all
                              humility we present unto Your Majesty. For when Your Highness had once out of deep
                              judgement apprehended how convenient it was, that out of the Original Sacred Tongues,
                              together with comparing of the labors, both in our own, and other foreign Languages,
                              of
                              many worthy men who went before us, there should be one more exact Translation of
                              the
                              holy Scriptures into the English Tongue; Your Majesty did never desist to urge
                              and to excite those to whom it was commended, that the work might be hastened, and
                              that
                              the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter of such importance
                              might justly require.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And now at last, by the mercy of God, and the continuance of our labors, it being
                              brought
                              unto such a conclusion, as that we have great hopes that the Church of England
                              shall reap good fruit thereby; we hold it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty, not
                              only
                              as to our King and Sovereign, but as to the principal Mover and Author of the work:
                              humbly craving of Your most Sacred Majesty, that since things of this quality have
                              ever
                              been subject to the censures of illmeaning and discontented persons, it may receive
                              approbation and patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as Your Highness
                              is,
                              whose allowance and acceptance of our labors shall more honor and encourage us, than
                              all
                              the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So that if,
                              on
                              the one side, we shall be traduced by Popish Persons at home or abroad, who therefore
                              will malign us, because we are poor instruments to make God's holy Truth to be yet
                              more
                              and more known unto the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and
                              darkness; or if, on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited Brethren,
                              who
                              run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing, but what is framed by themselves,
                              and
                              hammered on their anvil; we may rest secure, supported within by the truth and innocency
                              of a good conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as before
                              the

                              favor, which will ever give countenance to honest and christian endeavors against
                              bitter
                              censures and uncharitable imputations.
