                              seen
                              the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and

                              of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the
                              tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated by
                              the
                              gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of
                              a
                              surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings
                              which
                              are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not
                              of
                              man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven,
                              and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the
                              engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our
                              Lord
                              Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is
                              marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should
                              bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear
                              testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall
                              rid
                              our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat
                              of
                              Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the
                              Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.

                              has
                              shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith
