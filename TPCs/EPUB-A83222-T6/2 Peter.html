                              prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking
                              after their own lusts, 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell
                              asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were
                              of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store,
                              reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as
                              a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is
                              longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
                              should come to repentance. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the
                              heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with
                              fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons
                              ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens
                              being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
                              wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may
                              be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved
                              brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some
                              things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest,
                              as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also,
                              being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To
                              him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
