                              from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

                              of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy
                              Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you
                              for your sake.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much
                              affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia,
                              but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need
                              not to speak any thing.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and
                              how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; 
                           </p>

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
                              
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye
                              know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God
                              with much contention. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we
                              speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of
                              covetousness; God is witness: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have
                              been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto
                              you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear
                              unto us. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day,
                              because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the
                              gospel of God. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved
                              ourselves among you that believe: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a
                              father doth his children, 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
                              
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the
                              word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as
                              it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
                              believe. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in
                              Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even
                              as they have of the Jews: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us;
                              and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their
                              sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in
                              heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the
                              Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
                              the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
                              first:
