                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">O Prophet! when you divorce women, divorce them for their prescribed time, and
                              calculate the number of the days prescribed, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
                              your Lord. Do not drive them out of their houses, nor should they themselves go
                              forth, unless they commit an open indecency; and these are the limits of Allah, and
                              whoever goes beyond the limits of Allah, he indeed does injustice to his own soul.
                              You do not know that Allah may after that bring about reunion.So when they have reached their prescribed time, then retain them with kindness or
                              separate them with kindness, and call to witness two men of justice from among you,
                              and give upright testimony for Allah. With that is admonished he who believes in
                              Allah and the latter day; and whoever is careful of (his duty to) Allah, He will
                              make for him an outlet,And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not; and whoever trusts in Allah, He
                              is
                              sufficient for him; surely Allah attains His purpose; Allah indeed has appointed a
                              measure for everything.And (as for) those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, if you have a
                              doubt, their prescribed time shall be three months, and of those too who have not
                              had their courses; and (as for) the pregnant women, their prescribed time is that
                              they lay down their burden; and whoever is careful of (his duty to) Allah He will
                              make easy for him his affair.That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you, and whoever is careful
                              of
                              (his duty to) Allah, He will remove from him his evil and give him a big reward.Lodge them where you lodge according to your means, and do not injure them in order
                              that you may straiten them; and if they are pregnant, spend on them until they lay
                              down their burden; then if they suckle for you, give them their recompense and
                              enjoin one another among you to do good; and if you disagree, another (woman) shall
                              suckle for him.Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance and whoever has his means of
                              subsistence straitened to him, let him spend out of that which Allah has given him;
                              Allah does not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent to which He has granted
                              it; Allah brings about ease after difficulty.And how many a town which rebelled against the commandment of its Lord and His
                              apostles, so We called it to account severely and We chastised it (with) a stern
                              chastisement.So it tasted the evil result of its conduct, and the end of its affair was
                              perdition.Allah has prepared for them severe chastisement, therefore be careful of (your duty
                              to) Allah, O men of understanding who believe! Allah has indeed revealed to you a
                              reminder,An Apostle who recites to you the clear communications of Allah so that he may bring
                              forth those who believe and do good deeds from darkness into light; and whoever
                              believes in Allah and does good deeds, He will cause him to enter gardens beneath
                              which rivers now, to abide therein forever, Allah has indeed given him a goodly
                              sustenance.Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and of the earth the like of them; the decree
                              continues to descend among them, that you may know that Allah has power over all
                              things and that Allah indeed encompasses all things in (His) knowledge.
