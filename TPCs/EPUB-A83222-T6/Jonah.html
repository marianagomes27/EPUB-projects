                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness
                              is come up before me. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went
                              down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare
                              thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence
                              of the LORD. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest
                              in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth
                              the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah
                              was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper?
                              arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish
                              not. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may
                              know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell
                              upon Jonah. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon
                              us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and
                              of what people art thou? 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven,
                              which hath made the sea and the dry land. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this?
                              For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told
                              them. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm
                              unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the
                              sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon
                              you. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for
                              the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech
                              thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood:
                              for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from
                              her raging. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD,
                              and made vows. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the
                              belly of the fish three days and three nights.

                              might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was
                              exceeding glad of the gourd.

                              gourd that it withered.

                              wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in
                              himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I
                              do well to be angry, even unto death.

                              laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a
                              night:
