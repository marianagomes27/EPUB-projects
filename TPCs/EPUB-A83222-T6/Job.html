                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect
                              and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five
                              hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so
                              that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and
                              called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and
                              sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings
                              according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
                              sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
                              LORD, and Satan came also among them. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD,
                              and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in
                              it. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is
                              none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God,
                              and escheweth evil? 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he
                              hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance
                              is increased in the land. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee
                              to thy face. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon
                              himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the
                              LORD. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine
                              in their eldest brother's house: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the
                              asses feeding beside them: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the
                              servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is
                              fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed
                              them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made
                              out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and
                              slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to
                              tell thee. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy
                              daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four
                              corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I
                              only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the
                              ground, and worshipped, 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither:
                              the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. </p>

                              movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath
                              will he give for his life. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God,

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What?
                              shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they
                              came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite,
                              and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to
                              mourn with him and to comfort him.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up
                              their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust
                              upon their heads toward heaven.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none
                              spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
