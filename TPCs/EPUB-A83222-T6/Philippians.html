                              is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the
                              supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
                           </p>

                              ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be
                              magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with
                              Christ; which is far better: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all
                              for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to
                              you again.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I
                              come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand
                              fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token
                              of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but
                              also to suffer for his sake; 
                           </p>

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and

                              ministered to my wants.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him
                              only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may
