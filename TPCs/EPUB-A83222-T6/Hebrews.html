                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
                              likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had
                              the power of death, that is, the devil;

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he
                              might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to
                              make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
