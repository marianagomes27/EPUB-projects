                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
                              unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were

                              darkened.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own
                              hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature
                              more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did
                              change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their

                              receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them
                              over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

                              one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by
                              one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive

                              even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
                              justification of life.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of

                              called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so
                              that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.

                              that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead,
                              that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did
                              work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that
                              we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but
                              by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
                              covet. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
                              concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived,
                              and I died.

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it
                              might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the
                              commandment might become exceeding sinful. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. </p>

                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will
                              is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
                              in me. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and
                              bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
                           </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? </p>
                           <p align="justify" style="line-height:130%">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve
                              the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
